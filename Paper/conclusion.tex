\section{Conclusion}
	In this project, we focused on inferring the probability distribution of the utility functions of the users of a database, given a rating of a subset of the database items by a subset of the users. we proposed the use of a linear model to infer the dependency between the ratings and the database attributes. Then, with the aid of Gaussian mixture model and kernel density estimation, we proposed to build the general distribution of the utility functions. We also performed empirical studies to evaluate the models and their effectiveness in practice, although the measures that can be used for the evaluation of our results are limited and more effort should be devoted to developing methods in order to gauge the accuracy of the estimated probability distribution.
	
	In short, We have looked at the ratings provided by users on different items in the context of the items and based on their attributes. The model we have proposed for such an analysis enables us to provide useful information on the users' behavior that can be helpful for businesses. Furthermore, it can be used to design algorithms that take into account the preferences of the users of a database.
